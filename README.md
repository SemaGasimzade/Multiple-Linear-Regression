# Multiple-Linear-Regression
This project demonstrates how to build a multiple linear regression model in R using the "50_Startups" dataset. The goal is to predict company profit based on R&amp;D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State.
## 🔧 Technologies Used
- R
- caTools
- Base R functions for regression
- Feature Scaling

## 📊 Steps Performed
- Loaded dataset and split into training/test sets
- Applied feature scaling to standardize values
- Trained a multiple linear regression model
- Predicted profits on test data
- Summarized model performance

## 📁 Files
- `50_Startups.csv` — dataset used
- `multiple_regression_model.R` — model script

## 📎 Output
Model summary and prediction output available in R console.
